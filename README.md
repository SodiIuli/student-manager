## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# **Student Manager Application**

## _Introduction_
This application is an exercise for the FIS laboratory. You can find the lab assignment on the [lab web page](http://labs.cs.upt.ro/~oose/pmwiki.php/FSE/LAB2019).

The application is meant to help you learn _Git_. At the same time, we aim at giving you a very short introduction to JavaFX.

## _Java FX_
Java FX is a software framework for delivering UI desktop applications. It is the newest alternative to Java Swing.
This demo project used as inspiration the [official Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/form.htm).

## Issue Tracking
For the purpose of demonstrating a complete Agile Workflow, we created a Jira instance that you can find [here](https://loose.atlassian.net/projects/SM/issues). You will need to use the ID's of the User Stories created there in your commit messages.

## _Happy Coding_
Have a nice time implementing the project!
